# dental-segmentation-using-UNET
# This research focuses on dental image segmentation using diverse segmentation models. Among these models, Residual UNET with binary cross-entropy achieved the best results. Despite obtaining favorable accuracy, other UNET models exhibited lower Intersection of Union (IOU) values in segmentation masks. A consistent pattern emerged through meticulous metric comparison across varied groups employing diverse augmentation techniques and loss functions. Notably, the ChannelShuffle augmentation technique coupled with the ChannelShuffle augmentation, Residual UNET Model, employing binary cross-entropy and ADAM Optimizer, consistently showcased commendable performance across accuracy, mean IOU, and dice coefficient. The most noteworthy outcomes were consistently observed within the "Data Augmentation Techniques Using 50% albumentations with binary cross-entropy" group, opting for a 50% augmentation strength and previous edge-aware loss functions. Remarkably, the ChannelShuffle technique within this group yielded an accuracy of 96.561, a mean IOU of 94.108, and a dice coefficient of 93.102.
